# Cats Galore

### Basic functionalities
* Display all the cats as a CatTile component
* Each cat should display their picture, name, number of likes, a like button, and a learn more button
* Clicking on a learn more button for a cat will remove the cat's likes and like button, and instead show a string that says something like, "Kenny's favorite toy is a baby dog and they are a 8-year old female cat."
* Search for a cat by name on the home page
* Add a new cat by filling out the form

### CRUD operations
* See all the cats on the page (READ)
* Create a new cat through the form (CREATE)
* Increase a cat's likes (UPDATE)
* Send a cat to your parents' house (DELETE)
